key comprised of 5 parts: x0, y0, r, T, R
x0 and y0 E (0, 1) are initial states of 2D logistic map
r E (1.11, 1.19) is the system parameter of 2D logistic map
T is the control parameter, eq. 3
  (sum / L) * x0 mod 1
  sum = sum(f(i,j)), L is a system constant?!?!
R is the iteration number, eq. 4
  (sum(f(i,j)) mod 3.1 ) + 2

fraction decimal numbers of x0,y0,r,T are converted to binary format of 52 bits per number
R is represented in 48 bits
